## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Python workflow automation with batch processing
- Temporal trend analysis for contamination monitoring
- Web application interface
- Machine learning classification enhancement
- Mobile field validation app

---

## [1.5.4] - 2025-01-09

### Fixed
- **Water quality layer wet soil misclassification**: Raised AWEINSH threshold from 0.0 to 0.20
  - Real water bodies (depth) have AWEINSH > 0.20-0.30
  - Wet bare soil (surface moisture) has AWEINSH < 0.20
  - Validated: Ganau Lake water=0.249, wet soil=0.18-0.19
  - Removed NIR threshold approach (unreliable for contaminated water with suspended particles)

### Changed
- Optimized unified water mask for better land/water separation
- Enhanced discrimination between irrigated agriculture and water bodies

---

## [1.5.3] - 2025-01-08

### Fixed
- Initial attempt at wet soil exclusion using NIR < 5% threshold
- Identified limitation: Contaminated water can have elevated NIR (4-5%) overlapping with wet soil

### Notes
- Version superseded by v1.5.4 with superior AWEINSH-based approach

---

## [1.5.2] - 2025-01-08

### Fixed
- **Critical water quality layer blank issue**: Water bodies showing no color in Water Quality Classification
  - Root cause: `.selfMask()` in `createBooleanClassification()` masked all water pixels (value 0)
  - Mask propagated through `isLandAMD.not()` causing entire water quality layer to be masked
  - Solution: Added `.unmask(0)` before land AMD overlap exclusion check
  - Validated: Ganau Lake (675 mg/L sulfate) now correctly displays contamination

### Added
- Comprehensive masking logic documentation

---

## [1.5.1] - 2025-01-05

### Changed
- Removed water classification classes (20, 21) from land AMD module to prevent overlap
- Water quality now exclusively handled by dedicated Water Quality Classification module
- Updated legend to direct users to Water Quality layer

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-03

### Added
- **Water Quality Classification Module**: Novel 3-class system for contaminated water detection
  - Clean water (blue), Moderate contamination (orange), Severe contamination (red)
  - Multi-criteria contamination scoring (0-7 points)
  - Spectral indices: NIR anomaly, turbidity, iron water index, yellow index
- **Unified Water Mask**: Multi-criteria approach (MNDWI, AWEINSH, brightness, NDVI, NDWI)
- **Depth filtering**: Excludes shallow water to improve accuracy
- **Land/Water separation**: Explicit mutual exclusivity between modules

### Research Innovation
- First implementation extending USGS terrestrial mineral detection to water quality assessment
- Validated against ground truth measurements (Ganau Lake: 675 mg/L sulfate)

### Fixed

#### Critical Fixes
- **Negative Reflectance Values:** Added `.clamp(0.0, 1.0)` to ensure valid reflectance range
  - Issue: Landsat Collection 2 scaling formula produced negative values for low-signal pixels
  - Solution: Clip all reflectance values to physically valid range [0.0, 1.0]
  - Impact: Iron Sulfate Index now shows positive values (0.5-2.5 range)

#### Landsat Scaling
- Corrected Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Reflectance formula
  - Formula: Reflectance = (DN × 0.0000275) - 0.2
  - Applied clipping after scaling to prevent negatives
  - Verified against USGS official documentation

#### Water Masking
- Improved water detection with dual-index approach
- Fixed false positives in water classification
- Enhanced contaminated water detection logic

### Changed

#### Code Structure
- Reorganized processing functions for clarity
- Added comprehensive comments explaining methodology
- Improved error handling and diagnostics

#### Documentation
- Enhanced code comments with band descriptions
- Added threshold explanations
- Included paper references (Rockwell et al. 2021)

#### User Experience
- Improved statistics panel formatting
- Better legend organization (6 AMD classes + 11 other classes)
- More informative console output

### Removed
- Removed commented-out alternative scaling methods
- Removed redundant masking logic

### Technical Details

#### Landsat Collection 2 Processing
```javascript
// Scaling formula (official USGS)
var scaled = bands.multiply(0.0000275).add(-0.2);

// Clipping to valid range
var clipped = scaled.clamp(0.0, 1.0);
```

#### Sentinel-2 Processing
```javascript
// Scaling with clipping
var scaled = image.select(['B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'B4', 'B8', 'B11', 'B12'])
  .multiply(0.0001)
  .clamp(0.0, 1.0)
  .rename(['SR_B1', 'SR_B2', 'SR_B3', 'SR_B4', 'SR_B5', 'SR_B6', 'SR_B7']);
```

#### Classification Logic
- 19 classes with priority-based assignment
- Water masking applied before classification
- Extreme AMD (Iron > 2.0) overrides water mask
- Contaminated water detection (Iron > 1.8 in water)

### Testing

#### Validation
- ✅ Statistics show positive Iron Sulfate Index (0.5-2.5 range)
- ✅ Band reflectances in valid range (0.0-0.4)
- ✅ All 19 classes visualize correctly
- ✅ Paper validation sites ready for comparison

#### Paper Validation Sites

- Bauer Mill, UT: Expected Iron Sulfate 0.9-1.4
