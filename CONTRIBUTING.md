## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or suggest features
- Provide clear descriptions with reproducible examples
- Include study area coordinates, sensor type, and software versions

### Code Contributions
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines below
4. **Test thoroughly** with multiple study areas
5. **Commit with clear messages** (`git commit -m 'Add validation for X region'`)
6. **Push to your fork** (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
7. **Open a Pull Request** with detailed description of changes

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript (Google Earth Engine)
- Use descriptive variable names (`waterMask` not `wm`)
- Comment complex algorithms with methodology references
- Include units in threshold variable names (`scoreThresholdModerate` not `threshold1`)
- Maintain existing function structure and naming conventions

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters
- Include docstrings with parameter descriptions
- Write unit tests for new functions

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md following semantic versioning
- Include methodology references in technical documentation
- Provide examples for new functionality

## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Validation studies**: Test tool in new geographic regions with ground truth data
- **Algorithm optimization**: Improve processing speed for large watersheds
- **Python workflow**: Complete automated batch processing capability
- **Documentation**: Tutorials, video guides, case studies

### Research Opportunities
- **Machine learning integration**: Enhance classification accuracy
- **Temporal analysis**: Trend detection algorithms
- **New sensors**: Integration with additional satellite platforms
- **Hydrological modeling**: Coupling with water quality models

### Community Support
- **Answer questions** in GitHub Discussions
- **Share case studies** from your research applications
- **Translate documentation** to other languages
- **Create educational materials** for workshops/courses

## Testing Requirements

Before submitting code:
1. Test with at least 3 different study areas
2. Verify both Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 sensors work
3. Check water quality classification on known contaminated sites
4. Ensure no errors in Earth Engine Code Editor console
5. Validate spectral index calculations match published methodology

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix

- `style`: Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Example:**
```
feat: Add AWEINSH threshold optimization for wet soil exclusion

Implements adaptive water masking using AWEINSH > 0.20 to separate
true water bodies from wet bare soil. Validated against Ganau Lake
ground truth measurements.

Fixes #42
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

Your PR should:
- Address a specific issue or feature
- Include clear description of changes and rationale
- Reference any related issues (`Fixes #123`)
