## 📋 Pre-Publication Tasks

### 1. Update Personal Information
Before making repository public, verify:
- [ ] Add your ORCID ID to CITATION.cff (line 9)
- [ ] Update email in CITATION.cff if needed (currently contact@climtawy.com)
- [ ] Verify www.climtawy.com website is live and professional

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Create new repository: `coodawy/AMD-Detection-Tool`
- [ ] Add repository description: "Advanced remote sensing system for acid mine drainage detection and water quality monitoring using satellite imagery"
- [ ] Add topics/tags: `remote-sensing`, `environmental-monitoring`, `water-quality`, `google-earth-engine`, `landsat`, `sentinel-2`, `acid-mine-drainage`, `geospatial`
- [ ] Enable Issues for community engagement
- [ ] Enable Discussions for Q&A and collaboration
- [ ] Set repository to Public

### 3. Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Create GitHub repository social preview image (1280x640px)
  - Suggest: Map visualization showing contamination detection
  - Include project title and www.climtawy.com
- [ ] Add shields/badges to README (already included)
- [ ] Register for DOI with Zenodo for academic citations
- [ ] Create GitHub Pages site for documentation (optional)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for automated testing (future)

### 4. Development Files Organization
Current development documentation files in root (can be moved to docs/development/):
- BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- GIT_CHEATSHEET.md
- GITHUB_SETUP.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- INDEX.md
- ISSUE_5_FIX.md
- MISSING_FEATURES.md
- PAPER_VALIDATION_TEMPLATE.md
- PATCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- PROJECT_PLAN.md
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
- SCALING_FIX.md
- UI_FIX_SUMMARY.md
- V1.0.0_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- V1.1.0_COMPACT_SUMMARY.md
- V1.1.0_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
- V1.1.0_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md
- amd_detection_v4_fixed.js (old version)

**Recommendation**: Keep these files but move to `docs/development/` to keep root clean.

### 5. Python Code Review
- [ ] Review `python/amd_detection.py` for AI-sounding comments
- [ ] Verify `python/requirements.txt` has correct versions
- [ ] Test Jupyter notebook if sharing publicly
- [ ] Add Python README if different from main README

### 6. Social Media & Professional Network
For maximum visibility:
- [ ] Announce on LinkedIn with project link
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X with hashtags: #RemoteSensing #WaterQuality #OpenScience #EnvironmentalMonitoring
- [ ] Post on ResearchGate
- [ ] Add to Google Scholar profile
- [ ] Submit to Earth Engine Community Catalog (optional)
- [ ] Consider blog post on www.climtawy.com explaining impact

### 7. Academic Visibility
- [ ] Register DOI with Zenodo for permanent archiving
- [ ] Submit to Earth Engine Community showcase
- [ ] Consider preprint on EarthArxiv or similar
- [ ] Add to relevant GitHub awesome-lists (awesome-earth-engine, awesome-remote-sensing)

## Metrics to Track

For demonstrating impact:
- GitHub stars
- Repository forks
- Issue discussions
- Pull requests from community
- Downloads/clones
- Website traffic to www.climtawy.com from GitHub
- Citations (Google Scholar alerts)
- LinkedIn engagement on announcement

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Do NOT Include in Public Repository
- Personal emails (except professional contact@climtawy.com)
- Sensitive location data beyond what's already in study areas
- Unpublished research data
- Internal development notes with sensitive information

### Maintain Professionalism
- All commit messages should be clear and professional
- Respond to issues within 7 days
- Thank contributors publicly
- Keep discussions constructive and welcoming

## 🚀 Publication Steps

When ready to publish:

1. **Final code review** - Run through entire JavaScript file
2. **Test functionality** - Verify all study areas work
3. **Spell check** - All markdown documentation
4. **Update dates** - Ensure all "Last Updated" dates are current
5. **Push to GitHub** - Create repository and push code
6. **Configure repository** - Settings, topics, description
7. **Announce** - Social media and professional networks
8. **Monitor** - Set up notifications for issues and stars

## ✨ Post-Publication Maintenance

First 30 Days:
- Respond to all issues within 48 hours
- Welcome new contributors
- Fix any bugs reported quickly
- Track star growth and engagement

Ongoing:
- Monthly updates if active development continues
- Quarterly check of dependencies and security
- Annual review of documentation accuracy
- Consider versioned releases with DOI for major updates
